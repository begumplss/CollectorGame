# CollectorGame
## Unity Exercise Game

This project is a Unity-based game developed as part of an exercise from online tutorials. The purpose of the game is to apply fundamental Unity mechanics and enhance problem-solving skills through scripting and interaction with various game objects. The code has evolved and adapted to different issues encountered during development, ensuring a hands-on approach to learning. All assets used in this game have been sourced from the free category of the Unity Asset Store.

## Features

- **Player Movement**: Control the player using keyboard inputs for movement and mouse for camera rotation.
- **Gold Collection**: The player collects gold coins scattered across the environment. The collected gold is tracked and displayed on the screen.
- **Enemy Interaction**: Physical collisions with enemies trigger audio feedback and cause the player to stop, simulating damage.
- **Rigidbody Physics**: The player character interacts with the environment and enemies using Unity's Rigidbody component to create realistic motion and collision effects.

## How to Play

- Move the player using the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys.
- Use the mouse to control the camera and look around.
- Collect gold coins to increase your score.
- Avoid enemies, as collisions will stop the game.
